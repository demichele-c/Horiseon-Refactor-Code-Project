# First Challenge for UCF Full Stack Coding Bootcamp

## This was my first project for the UCF Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I was given source code that was missing alt attributes, needed some adjusting to the semantic flow of the HTML, and needed some changes to the CSS stylesheet. 

## Proceses and Challenges 

```
FIRST I adjusted structure of HTML to flow better using classes and semantic elements
THEN I added alt tags for accessibility
THEN I adjusted CSS style sheet to work with new classes and deleted attriubutes 
```
